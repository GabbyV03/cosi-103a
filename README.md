# Spring 2024 COSI-103A Group T RecipeApp

## Description

RecipeApp is a web application that allows users to browse through a variety of recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions. You can also add new recipes, or enter ingredients into your grocery list.

## Getting Started with our Recipe App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We used primarily JavaScript and CSS for this project but we are currently working on including Docker Microsoft Azure

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd recipeapp`

Navigate into the project directory.

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Start the application.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner if needed

### Usage
After starting the application, you can browse through the recipes, pages, and utilize the features including a grocery list, a "Cooking Mode", and a form to add new recipes.

## Pages & Features

When you load the app, you will can navigate to several pages using the navigation bar:

- **Landing Page**: This page displays a summary of our recipes. You can click on the "View Recipe" button to take you to the full recipe page.

- **Recipe Page**: This page displays the full recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions as well as a helpful image!

- **Team Page**: This page introduces our team members. Each member's profile includes a photo and our name.

- **Grocery List**: It is displayed somewhere on each screen and allows the user to add ingredients to the grocery list, delete individual items or clear the entire list.

- **Cooking Mode**: Each recipe has a link to the mobile-friendly "Cooking Mode" page, which displays the instructions in a kitchen-friendly way, shows only the recipe's instructions, and the instructions take up the entire screen in a large font.

- **Add New Recipes**: On the recipe page, you can find a text box for you to enter a recipe in JSON format.
For example, if you enter {"name": "Your Recipe Name", "ingredients": ["Ingredient1", "Ingredient2"], "steps": ["Step1", "Step2"], "imageUrl": "SourceOfYourImage.com/image.jpg"}, then your recipe titled "Your Recipe Name" will be visible across all users in the list of recipes!
