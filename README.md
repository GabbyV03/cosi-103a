# Spring 2024 COSI-103A Group T
## Getting Started with our Recipe App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We used primarily JavaScript and CSS for this project but we are currently working on including Docker and Microsoft Azure.

## Available Scripts

If cloning from GitHub, please cd into the RecipeApp folder by running: 

### `cd recipeapp`

In order to install all the dependencies needed to run our app, you need to run:

### `npm i`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Pages

When you load the app, you will see several pages:

- **Landing Page**: This page displays a summary of our recipes. You can click on the "View Recipe" button to take you to the full recipe page.

- **Recipe Page**: This page displays the full recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions as well as a helpful image!

- **Team Page**: This page introduces our team members. Each member's profile includes a photo and our name.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
