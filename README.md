# Spring 2024 COSI-103A Group T RecipeApp

## Description

RecipeApp is a web application that allows users to browse through a variety of recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions. You can also save ingredients to an editable grocery list.

## Getting Started with our Recipe App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We used primarily JavaScript and CSS for this project but we are currently working on including Docker Microsoft Azure

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd recipeapp`

Navigate into the project directory.

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Start the production server ran on an Express server, and builds the static file folder at 8000 (locahost:8000)

### 'npm run start-client'

Start the development server at 3000, proxied to 8000 (localhost:3000)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner if needed

### Usage
After starting the application, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You can browse through the recipes by clicking on the recipe names in the navigation bar.
